Introduction

The SDM72D-M-2 is digital 3 phase 4 wires energy meter with white back-lighted LCD screen for perfect reading.
The unit measures and displays voltage, current, frequency, power factor, active power, reactive power, active
energy and reactive energy, etc. A resettable partial energy is provided, so the user can easily check the active
energy imported and active energy exported during a certain period. SDM72D-M-2 supports max.100A direct
connection, saving the cost and avoiding the trouble to connect external CTs, giving the unit a cost-effective and
east operation. Built-in interfaces provide pulse and RS485 Modbus RTU outputs. Configuration is password
protected.

PART 3 Modbus Protocol
    Input Registers


Input registers are used to indicate the present values of the measured and calculated electrical quantities. Each
parameter is held in two consecutive 16 big register. The following table details the 3X register address, and the
values of the the address bytes within the message. A (*) in the column indicated the parameter is valid for the
particular wiring system, Any parameter with a cross (X) will return the value zero. Each parameter is held in the 3X
registers. Modbus Protocol function code 04 is used to access all parameters.
For example, to request: Amps 1 Start address = 0006
                                       No.of registers = 0002
                             Amps 2 Start address = 0008
                                       No. Of register = 0002
Each request for data must be restricted to 30 parameters or less. Exceeding the 30 parameter limit will cause a
Modbus Protocol exception code to be returned.

                                                                                                                      Modbus

   Holding Registers


Holding register are used to store and display instrument configuration settings. All holding registers not listed
in the table below should be considered as reserved for manufacturer use and no attempt should be made to
modify their values.
The holding register parameters may be viewed or changed using the Modbus Protocol. Each parameter is held
in two consecutive 4X registers. Modbus Protocol Function Code 03 is used to read the parameter and Function
code 10 is used to write. Write only to one parameter per massage.
